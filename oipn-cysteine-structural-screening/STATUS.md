# Progress checkpoint

Protocol: 0.1.0. Audit recorded: 2026-10-08. Workstation target: Ubuntu Linux.

## Completed

- Ten-step protocol and structural scoring specification frozen.
- Official GSE286387 inputs audited: 40,481 unique stable IDs; identical redundant annotation rows collapsed without summing.
- User's Ubuntu R 4.3.3 / DESeq2 1.42.1 sample QC reproduced and committed under `docs/audits/ubuntu_2026-10-08`.
- Full study methods and sample QC reviewed: Step 01 accepted with documented metadata limitations. All ten libraries retained; five control and five oxaliplatin. Frozen unpaired model `~ condition`.
- Accepted manifest and checksum-bound design committed in config; see `docs/DATASET_DESIGN_AUDIT.md`.
- Step 02 implemented and run on real inputs in R 4.3.3 / DESeq2 1.42.0: 18,538 tested, 18,503 valid p-values, 854 significant coding genes (477 up / 377 down). This is implementation validation, not the user's final workstation DE run.
- Eleven input-integrity, QC integration, BH/selection-contract and frozen-input gate tests passed.

## Workstation reproduction and review completed

The actual Ubuntu R 4.3.3 / DESeq2 1.42.1 snapshot is uploaded and reviewed at source commit d80a26859ad54577ebf4021e87ef4f4a0cb8cac0. All eight snapshot checksums, configuration provenance, sample identities and model matrix pass. Discovery has 854 unique significant coding genes (477 up / 377 down); exact membership matches implementation validation. See docs/audits/ubuntu_DE_2026-10-08/REVIEW.md. The accepted discovery file/checksum is bound in config/GSE286387_step03_input.json.

## Pending

Step 03 protein mapping and sequence retrieval have not started. No structures, structural ranking, validation or enrichment has run. Original animal identifiers, batch, collection age and exact final-dose interval remain documented limitations. The selected snapshot does not include full all-gene p-values; workstation BH was not independently recomputed from that upload. GSE125002 remains a separate unaudited complementary candidate.

## Next

Step 03: version-aware mapping of the accepted 854 mouse stable gene IDs to canonical proteins and sequences, with an audit for every input gene and explicit missing/ambiguous statuses. Do not assume one protein per gene or resolve identity by symbol alone.
